# Stanford Data Science for Social Good 2019
Introduction to D3.js workshop for the 2019 Stanford Data Science for Social Good.

## What is D3.js?

"D3 (Data-Driven Documents or D3.js) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML.  D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction."

## Setting Up D3

There are two ways you can setup D3.js for your visualization:

* Download [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/download/v5.9.7/d3.zip) and access it locally
* Use [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3) to access it remotely


## Documentation

D3.js is extremely well documented.  This should be the first place you turn if you need help: https://d3js.org/
